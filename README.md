# Create-package-in-npm
Creating a new package in npm (Node Package Manager) involves several steps, from setting up your project to publishing it on the npm registry. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide to help you through the process:

mkdir my-new-package
cd my-new-package

## Create Your Package Code
    npm init -y
  
    touch index.js


## Add your code to index.js. For instance, a simple module might look like this:
    // index.js
    module.exports = function() {
      console.log("Hello, world!");
    }


## To test your package locally, you can link it using npm link:
    npm link



## Then, in another project, you can use this linked package by running:
    npm link my-new-package


## Add Additional Metadata (Optional) : 
    {
      "name": "my-new-package",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "A simple example package",
      "main": "index.js",
      "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
      },
      "repository": {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "git+https://github.com/username/my-new-package.git"
      },
      "keywords": ["example", "npm", "package"],
      "author": "Your Name <your.email@example.com>",
      "license": "MIT",
      "bugs": {
        "url": "https://github.com/username/my-new-package/issues"
      },
      "homepage": "https://github.com/username/my-new-package#readme"
    }


## Before publishing, make sure you are logged into npm: 
    npm login

## After logging in, publish your package using:
    npm publish

 ## Update Your Package : 
If you make changes to your package and want to publish a new version, update the version number in your package.json according to semantic versioning rules (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.1.0, etc.), and run:

    npm publish


# Note - 

## Check Package Name Availability
Ensure that the package name you chose is available. You can do this by searching for the package on npmjs.com. If the name is taken, choose a different, unique name.

## Ensure Correct User Login
     npm whoami

## If this is not your intended user, log out and log back in:

    npm logout
    npm login

## Scoped Packages

If you are using a scope (e.g., @username/my-new-package), make sure you publish it with the scope:

    npm publish --access public

## Ensure that your package.json file reflects the scoped name:

    {
      "name": "@your-username/my-new-package",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      // other fields
    }
